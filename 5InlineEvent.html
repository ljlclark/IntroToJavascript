  <p>
    There are many different events that can occur and each one has a specific
    name. One of the most common events is a "click" event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Event Handler code can be assigned at the element level. This code will
    be run for only that element and that is the only code that will be
    executed for that element event.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an example of the Button element running the inline event handler
    code to jump to a different page when it is clicked with the mouse button.
    <br />
    &lt;button onclick="window.location.href='4Events.html'"&gt;&lt;-
    Javascript&lt/button&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    The "onclick" event is assigned the handler code "window.location.href=
    '4Events.html'". This jumps to the specified page when the button is
    clicked.
  </p>
  <button onclick="window.location.href='4Events.html'">&lt;- Events</button>
  <p>
    This type of event handler code should only used if there is one or two code
    statements to be executed.
