  <p>
    The functions created so far have all become part of the "window" object.
  </p>
  <p>
    If another script file is loaded with a function using the same name, then
    the previous function is replaced with the new function. In this case it
    can be a challenge to figure out what is wrong. This is where OOP is useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    With OOP a Class definition can be created that contains the data values
    and methods required to provide some custom object behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an object is created from that Class; the created object is added
    to the "window" object and it's name must be unique for that page. However,
    the data and function names inside the object are safe. This is called
    encapsulation; because the data and functions are contained in the object.
  </p>
  <p>
    An object is create from a Class by using the "new" keyword.<br />
    let myObject = new MyClass();
