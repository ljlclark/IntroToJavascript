    The functions created so far have all become part of the "window" object.
    They are called Global functions because they can be called from anywhere
    in the Javascript.
  </p>
  <p>
    If another script file is loaded with a global function using the same name,
    then the previous function is replaced with the new function. In this case
    it can be hard to figure out what is wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an object or other data is created in Javascript, outside of a function
    or another object, they also are Global and must have a unique name in the
    parent page.
  </p>
  <p>
    With OOP, a Class definition can be created that contains the data values
    and methods required to provide custom object behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an object is created from that Class the data and method names inside
    the object do not have to be unique from other objects. This is called
    encapsulation; because the data and methods are contained and protected in
    the object.
  </p>
  <p>
    An object is create from a Class by using the "new" keyword.<br />
    let myObject = new MyClass();
