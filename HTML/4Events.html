    <p>
      When something happens, such as an element being clicked by a
      mouse button, developers say that an Event has occurred. Sometimes it is
      said that an Event has been "raised".
    </p>
    <p>
      The page will be notified that an Event has occured. Javascript
      code can be assigned to run whenever that event is raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code that is assigned to run when an event occurs is called an
      Event Handler.
