    <p>
      Up to this point, changes have been made directly to existing objects in
      the DOM. Often it is better to create a temporary variable that is easier
      to use.
      <!-- and can be modified without changing the original value. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      In script that is not in "strict" mode, a variable can be created by just
      typing the variable name and assigning it a value.
    </p>
    <p>myVar = "value";</p>
    <p>
      This creates a global variable of type "string" where the value and type can
      be changed anywhere in the script. It is easy with this syntax to create
      errors that are hard to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      A variable can also be created using the "var" keyword.
    </p>
    <p>var myVar = "value";</p>
    <p>
      This variable will belong to the function, class or method where it is
      defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using "var", the variable value and type can still be redefined somewhere
      else in the code. As in: var myVar = 5;. Now the variable type is "numeric"
      which has a different behavior than a type of "string".
