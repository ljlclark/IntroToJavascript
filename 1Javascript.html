  <p>
    Javascript is a client-side scripting language. This means that it runs
    in the browser. It is used to program web pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    When something happens, such as an element being clicked by a
    mouse button, we say that an Event has occurred. Sometimes it
    is said that an Event has been "raised".
  </p>
  <p>
    The page will be notified that an Event as occured. Javascript
    code can be assigned to run whenever that event is raised.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code that is assigned to run when an event occurs is called an
    Event Handler.
