  <h3 id="title">Document Object Model</h3>
  <p>
    The Document Object Model is often just called the "DOM".
  </p>
  <p>
    Javascript cannot use the HTML Document file text directly. Instead
    it uses DOM objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an HTML page is first loaded into the browser; it creates a
    programmable object tree from the HTML file text. This is a structure
    of DOM objects that represent the HTML Document.
  </p>
  <p>
    A DOM object can contain other DOM objects just like HTML elements can
    contain other HTML elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    A DOM object can contain "Methods". These methods are blocks of code that
    have a unique name. The code in the method can be executed by using the
    method name. This is referred to as "Calling" the method or a method
    "Call".
  </p>
  <p>
    A DOM object can contain "Properties" and property values similar to an
    HTML element property.
  </p>
  <p>
    An object's contained objects, methods and properties are called "members".
    This is because they belong to the object and can only be used by first
    specifying the object name, then a dot "." and then the contained member
    name. As in the object: window.location.
